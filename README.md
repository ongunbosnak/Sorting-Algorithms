# Sorting-Algorithms
You will write a sorting program. Your program will not use any of the pythonâ€™s internal sorting algorithms such as sort, sorted, min, max, etc. You are not allowed to use external libraries. Now, your program will ask a list of words from the user (English alphabet will be used), sort the words alphabatially, and then print the sorted list. The sorting rules are as follows: 1) H to Z will be alphabatically sorted, so does A-G, but Z will come before A. 2) Space character will be in between Z and A 3) The numbers will be sorted such that A&lt;9&lt;B, D&lt;8&lt;E, H&lt;7&lt;I, L&lt;6&lt;M, T&lt;5&lt;4&lt;3&lt;2&lt;1&lt;0&lt;U No lower case character will be considered. If you only sort with respect to the first letters of the words correctly, you get 10 points. If you sort them for the reset of the letters (a complete sorting)
